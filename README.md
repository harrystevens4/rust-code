# So what's going on here?

If you've seen my c-code repository, its in a similar vein to that; This repository contains "small" projects that were not noteworthy of their own repository.

# About

If the project is noteworthy it will contain a `README.md`

# Install

Figure it out yourself. Everything is set up for cargo.
Example: `cargo install --path lwrap` or maybe `cargo build --release ; sudo cp target/release/lwrap /usr/bin`
